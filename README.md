# Anomaly-Recognition-and-Imaging-Correction-of-Lamb-Wave-Array-Based-on-Joint-Sparse-Representation
This repository is for restoring and sharing the code and data for study named Anomaly Recognition and Imaging Correction for Lamb Wave Array Testing via Joint Sparse Representation Approach.
The program performs compression-reduction and rectification of lamb wave data from the signal level. The algorithm includes anomaly detection, hypothesis testing and signal reconstruction.
The hyperparameters and tranning strategy can be determined by the size and feature of the dataset.
